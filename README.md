# Pool Billiard Tournament Tracker 🎱

Welcome to the **Pool Billiard Tournament Tracker**! This project was born out of the need to organize friendly pool billiard competitions among friends in a billiard bar called "Pocket Bar" in Turku, Finland. With limited boards available, we wanted a way to track scores, manage tournaments, and determine winners without the hassle of manual tracking. This software solution makes it easy to organize and enjoy our weekly pool sessions!

## Features ✨

-   **Tournament Management**: Create and manage tournaments with ease.
-   **Score Tracking**: Track scores for each match and determine winners automatically.
-   **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Access the app on any device, whether it's a smartphone, tablet, or desktop.
-   **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Install the app on your device for offline access and a native app-like experience.

## Why This Project? 🤔

Every week, my friends and I gather to play pool billiard. However, with limited boards available, it became challenging to keep track of scores and determine winners. This project was created to:

-   Automate score tracking and tournament management.
-   Eliminate the need for manual scorekeeping.
-   Make our weekly pool sessions more organized and enjoyable.
